SampleHtmlScraper
=================
This is a really simple HTML scraper tool written in csharp using version 4 
of the .Net framework and written in Visual Studio 2013.

I wanted to create a simple demonstration of exactly how one goes about scraping using selenium and i have added an example
for IE browsing and for phantomJs to do headless browsing.

Download it and have a look.
